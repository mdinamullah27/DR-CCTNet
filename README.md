## 🎯 Overview

This work proposes **DR-CCTNet**, a Modified Compact Convolutional Transformer designed to:

- Classify diabetic retinopathy from retinal fundus images
- Operate efficiently on **low-resolution inputs**
- Reduce computational complexity and training time
- Maintain strong classification accuracy

## 🧠 Methodology

- Multi-dataset fusion (5 public DR datasets)
- Image preprocessing and enhancement
- Extensive data augmentation
- Modified Compact Convolutional Transformer (CCT)
- Comparison with CNN baselines (VGG, ResNet, MobileNet)

---

## 📊 Results

- **Accuracy:** 90.17%
- Outperformed baseline CNN models
- Robust performance with low-resolution images
- Reduced training cost
